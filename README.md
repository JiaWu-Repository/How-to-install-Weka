# How-to-install-Weka
Ref: https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/

There are two versions of Weka: Weka 3.8 is the latest stable version and Weka 3.9 is the development version. New releases of these two versions are normally made once or twice a year. For the bleeding edge, it is also possible to download nightly snapshots of these two versions.

The stable version receives only bug fixes and feature upgrades that do not break compatibility with its earlier releases, while the development version may receive new features that break compatibility with its earlier releases.

Weka 3.8 and 3.9 feature a package management system that makes it easy for the Weka community to add new functionality to Weka. The package management system requires an internet connection in order to download and install packages.

# We choose Weka 3.9 the development version

## Developer version
This is the main development trunk of Weka and continues from the stable Weka 3.8 code line. It may receive new features that break backwards compatibility.
